# TicTacToeGUI using JAVA
 
The primary objective of this project is to create a playable version of Tic Tac Toe where users can play against a second opponent. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' in empty cells, aiming to form a line of their respective symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is designed to be intuitive and engaging, with a graphical interface providing visual feedback and facilitating user interactions.
