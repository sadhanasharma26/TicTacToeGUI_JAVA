# TicTacToeGUI using JAVA

A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface, built using Java Swing. Play against an AI opponent and keep track of your win/draw record with a live scoreboard!

## Features

- **Two Players:** Human (X) vs. AI (O)
- **AI Opponent:** The computer plays as 'O' and makes random valid moves after each human turn.
- **Scoreboard:** Displays number of X wins, O (AI) wins, and draws above the game grid. Score resets when the program restarts.
- **Visual Interface:** Clickable buttons for each cell with instant feedback.
- **Win/Draw Detection:** Notifies you when the game is over and who the winner is, or if itâ€™s a draw.

## Getting Started

- Java JDK 8 or above installed on your system.

## Gameplay

- You play as 'X'. Click any empty cell to make your move.
